In order to clone the repository to your VSCode, open the repository page and you should 'code' in green. Click it and you will see a URL. Click on the button on the right of the URL to copy the link. Then go to your VSCode, make sure there is no folder nor a file open. Go to source control and click on 'Clone repository.' Then you should paste the URL in the pop-up window. Then you should select a destination on your computer. After you chose the destination, there might be a pop-up on VSCode about trusting the authors. Click on 'Trust the authors' and that should be all for cloning the repository on your VSCode. 

Always pull before committing, always pull before pushing and never commit unversioned files!
